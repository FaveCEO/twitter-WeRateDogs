    "WeRateDogs is a twitter account that rates dogs with the rating being a denominator of 10 most of the time and its numerator is always greater than the denominator, twitter users/dog_owners also tend to state the dog stage in which their dogs belong, either doggo, floofer, pupper or puppo.

    "From this account with so many tweets and retweets about dogs one would like to know which breed of dogs is mainly owned by people and which dog tend to be the \"cutest\", knowing the cutest might be from the number of favorite count or the retweeted count but most times people do not always favorite or retweet a tweet because they like it, it might just be to view at a later time or they actually do find it very ridiculous and want others to see but in this study we will assume the favorite count or retweet is because users/viewers actually like what they see. \n",

    "The neural network which was used to predict images gave about 3 predictions of what could be in the image and this predictions always gave at least 2 types of breed a dog could be except if there was no dog at all in the image. After careful wrangling the dataset had about 113 different breeds. A bar chart was plot to check which breed occurred most using value counts and it shows that the Golden retriever is really owned by alot of people followed by the Labrador retriever, Pembroke and Chihuahua while the least common are the Scotch terrier, Bouvier des flandres, Entlebucher, and Clumber.
